Main Process
1. Create and initialize shared memory
2. Load the student list into shared memory
3. Create and initialize semaphores
4. Fork 5 child processes (one for each TA)
5. Wait for all child processes to complete
6. Clean up resources (shared memory and semaphores)

TA Process
1. Attempt to acquire its own semaphore and the next
2. Access the shared memory to get the next student number if successful.
3. Release the Semaphores
4. Simulate marking (random delay)
5. Write the student number and mark to its own file
6; Repeat until it has gone through the list 3 times
