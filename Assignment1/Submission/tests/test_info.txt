Varying ISR Execution Times: /tests/isr
Tests with progressively longer ISR execution times to observe the impact on overall performance.

Varying Context Save/Restore Times: /tests/context_switch
For each test, the random range for context save/restore times increases (e.g., 1-3ms, 3-5ms, 5-10ms, 10-20ms).

CPU-Intensive vs I/O-Intensive: /tests/cpu_io
Tests that are heavily CPU-bound and others that are I/O-bound.

Frequent vs Infrequent Interrupts: /tests/interrupts
Tests with many short interrupts and others with fewer, longer interrupts.

CPU Speed: /tests/cpu_speed
Simulate faster CPU speeds by reducing all CPU execution times by half each test case.
